# Loan Default Risk Analysis using EDA

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights in a loan application dataset. The objective is to identify factors influencing loan defaults, enabling a consumer finance company to minimize financial risks while ensuring creditworthy applicants are not rejected.

## Problem Statement
Loan-providing companies face challenges in approving loans due to insufficient credit history of applicants, leading to potential financial losses:

1. Approving loans for applicants likely to default.
2. Rejecting loans for applicants who are creditworthy.

Using EDA, this project aims to:
- Identify key variables that indicate a high risk of default.
- Provide actionable insights to improve loan approval decisions.
- Balance business growth with risk management.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three files containing information about:
1. Applicant attributes.
2. Loan details.
3. Loan status (approved, cancelled, refused, unused offer).

### Key Scenarios:
- **Payment Difficulties**: Late payments on instalments.
- **Timely Payments**: All other cases where payments are made on time.

## Business Objectives
1. Identify **driver variables** that indicate loan defaults.
2. Understand patterns to:
   - Deny loans to high-risk applicants.
   - Adjust loan terms for risky applicants (e.g., higher interest rates, lower amounts).
3. Minimize defaults while ensuring deserving applicants are not rejected.

## Approach
1. **Data Understanding**: Explore dataset structure, attributes, and summary statistics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **EDA Techniques**:
   - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
   - Visualization of key trends and patterns.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Highlight variables strongly associated with defaults.
   - Propose strategies for risk mitigation.

## Deliverables
1. Cleaned and processed dataset.
2. Visualizations showcasing trends and patterns.
3. A detailed report of findings and recommendations for loan approval strategies.
